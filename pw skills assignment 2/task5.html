    HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language.It is the standard language for creating Web pages.It describes the structure of a Web page.It consists of a series of elements that tell the browser how to display the content.It is the basic unit of creating a web page.HTML is a combination of Hypertext and Markup language. Hypertext defines the link between web pages. A markup language is used to define the text document within the tag which defines the structure of web pages.. HTML was created by Tim Berners-Lee in 1991. The first-ever version of HTML was HTML 1.0, but the first standard version was HTML 2.0, published in 1995.

    CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) allows you to create great-looking web pages.CSS can be used for very basic document text styling — for example, for changing the color and size of headings and links. It can be used to create a layout. CSS can save you time. Once you have a style sheet created, you can use it multiple times. The best practice for CSS is to save it as a .css file, separate from your .html file. The style sheet can then be linked to your HTML file. When you find a style that you like, you can apply it to as many pages as you’d like.. CSS allows you to apply styles to web pages. More importantly, CSS enables you to do this independently of the HTML that makes up each web page. It describes how a webpage should look: it prescribes colours, fonts, spacing, and much more. In short, you can make your website look however you want. CSS lets developers and designers define how it behaves, including how elements are positioned in the browser. While HTML uses tags, CSS uses rulesets. CSS is easy to learn and understand, but it provides powerful control over the presentation of an HTML document.

    JavaScript is the Programming Language for the Web.It can update and change both HTML and CSS.It can calculate, manipulate and validate data.JavaScript was intended to be a lightweight language used to make web pages more dynamic. It added simple effects, like showing and hiding elements with the click of a button — but it wasn’t long before developers realized that it could do much more.JavaScript was intended to be a lightweight language used to make web pages more dynamic.
